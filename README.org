#+PROPERTY: LOGGING nil

# Note: This readme works with the org-make-toc <https://github.com/alphapapa/org-make-toc> package, which automatically updates the table of contents.

This package provides an embark export buffer for org roam nodes, which is
super-useful when "harvesting" your org-roam knowledge base for sources
to be used for a specific paper, diary entry, development task, etc. The
buffer uses org-mode, and by default lists the selected org roam nodes in
a checklist, allowing to check off items as you are processing them.

* Screenshots

The [[screenshot1.png][first screenshot]] shows a checklist version of the org roam 
export buffer, while the [[screenshot1.png][second screenshot]] shows a read-only version
of the buffer. These buffers were obtained by searching org roam nodes for entries matching 
the term "python", then =embark-select=-ing the org roam nodes of interest, followed by 
=embark-export=.

** MELPA

Just browse MELPA packages using, for instance, =M-x package-list-packages=, and search for =embark-org-roam=. To set up access to the MELPA and/or MELPA Stable repositories, see [[https://github.com/melpa/melpa/?tab=readme-ov-file#usage][these instructions]].

** Manual

  Install these required packages:

  + =embark=
  + =org-roam=

  Then put this file in your load-path, and put this in your init file:

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'embark-org-roam)
  #+END_SRC

** Straight

  Put this in your init file:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package embark-org-roam
   :ensure t
   :straight (embark-org-roam
              :type git
              :host github
              :repo "bramadams/embark-org-roam")
   :after (org-roam embark)
   :demand t)
#+end_src

** Elpaca

  Put this in your init file:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package embark-org-roam
   :ensure t
   :elpaca (embark-org-roam
            :type git
            :host github
            :repo "bramadams/embark-org-roam")
   :after (org-roam embark)
   :demand t)
#+end_src

* Usage
:PROPERTIES:
:TOC:      :depth 0
:END:

Use =embark-select= to select all org roam nodes of interest,
then use =embark-export=, which will open a special org mode
buffer containing links to the selected nodes.

You can customize whether the exported buffer is read-only 
using the =embark-org-roam-readonly= variable. By default, the
buffer is _not_ read-only, resulting in an org-mode checklist.
